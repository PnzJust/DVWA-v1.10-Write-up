# DVWA v1.10 writeup

Writeup for each category and each difficulty
The challange is available [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/dvwa). 

The security level are low, medium, high or impossible. The security level changes the vulnerability level of DVWA:

-    Low - This security level is completely vulnerable and has no security measures at all. It's use is to be as an example of how web application vulnerabilities manifest through bad coding practices and to serve as a platform to teach or learn basic exploitation techniques.
-   Medium - This setting is mainly to give an example to the user of bad security practices, where the developer has tried but failed to secure an application. It also acts as a challenge to users to refine their exploitation techniques.
-   High - This option is an extension to the medium difficulty, with a mixture of harder or alternative bad practices to attempt to secure the code. The vulnerability may not allow the same extent of the exploitation, similar in various Capture The Flags (CTFs) competitions.
-   Impossible - This level should be secure against all vulnerabilities. It is used to compare the vulnerable source code to the secure source code.
